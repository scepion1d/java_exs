#Readme, notes

To switch to a different jdk in the idea ide we have to change things below:

    File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings
    File -> Project Structure -> Module Settings -> Tab: Sources: Language Level.
    File -> Project Structure -> Module Settings -> Tab: Dependencies: Module SDK.
    File -> Settings -> Compiler -> Java Compiler -> Target bytecode version.
    ..
    Then reload ide (close and open the whole project or the whole IDEA again)
